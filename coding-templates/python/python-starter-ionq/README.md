This example shows how to use Qiskit to run a simple quantum circuit on IonQ's quantum computer.
You could try it by yourself using the following code:

> **HINT:**
> As an alternative to Conda, you may use `requirements.txt` to create a virtual environment with the tooling of your choice.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate python-starter-ionq
python -m src
```
