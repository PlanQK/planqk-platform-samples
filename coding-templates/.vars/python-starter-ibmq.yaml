      The starter template shows how to use Qiskit to run a simple quantum circuit on a [IBMQ](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com) backend.
      
      The logic implements a simple quantum circuit to generate a random number, either based on a simulator or quantum computer. 
      As input, you can the number of bits (`n_bits`), which defines the range of random numbers between `0` and `2^n_bits - 1` (see [data.json](./input/data.json)).      
      Further, it provides a flag to specify whether to use a simulator or a real quantum computer, configurable through parameters (see [params.json](./input/params.json)).
  - name: USAGE_EXTENSION
    value: |-
      To run the project locally, the `program.py` requires the environment variable `QISKIT_IBM_TOKEN` to be set.
      For example, expose the variable in your terminal by `export QISKIT_IBM_TOKEN="<your_token>"`.
